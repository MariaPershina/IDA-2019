To pass this course, you need a passing grade for your homework assignments and a passing grade on the final exam. The overall grade of the course is the average (50/50) of the grades received for the homework and the final exam.

# Homework

Weekly homework assignments will be issued on Friday evening. They are due on the following Friday before noon (before the lecture) unless otherwise indicated.
Homework assignments are to be submitted in groups of three. 
Please sign up on StudIP for a homework group.
We reserve the right to change groups, relocate group members etc. at any point during the course.

Each homework set will be assigned points.
Each group member receives the same score of points for a jointly submitted homework set.
Therefore, each group must make sure that all group members contribute equally.
If problems arise in a group, please do not hesitate to consult with us. 
Assignments that are not handed in without *prior* notice and *justified* explanation receive zero points, thereby affecting the eventual grade.

The total set of points accumulated by a participant for all homework sets will be mapped onto a grade  (NB: not the proportion of points, but the actual number, because different homework sets might be weighted differently**.

# Final exam

**The following information is still preliminary!**

The final exam will take place on Friday January 31st 2020.
You will have four hours to complete the exam with calm focus.
You are allowed to bring 4 DIN A4 pages of **hand-written notes**. 
No electronic devices, no photocopies, no prints. 

# Retake

A retake exam is possible if the final exam is missed with *prior notice* and *justifiable reasons* (e.g., a doctor's order).
A retake is also possible for participants who failed to reach a passing grade in the final exam. 
To qualify for a retake, however, you need to score at least 1/4 of the points in the final exam.
It is not possible to use the retake to improve your grade if you reached a passing grade in the final exam the first time around.

The material covered in the retake also contains the lectures given in calendar week 6 of 2020, i.e., the week *after* the final exam.
